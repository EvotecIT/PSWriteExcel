# PSWriteExcel - PowerShell Module

*PSWriteExcel* is very basic (at the moment) PowerShell module to create Microsoft Excel workbooks without Microsoft Excel installed.

Overview of this module: https://evotec.xyz/hub/scripts/pswriteexcel-powershell-module/

It's main purpose is to support/create Excel for PSWinDocumentation (https://evotec.xyz/hub/scripts/pswindocumentation-powershell-module/) project. Depending on requirements of this project (and maybe few others) it may evolve or cover more feature sets.

## Example usage of Add-ExcelWorksheetData in action

## Credits

This module is based on EPPlus (<https://github.com/JanKallman/EPPlus>) and it's doing all the magic behind this project. PSWriteExcel is merely a wrapper around that with few PowerShell tricks around converting objects into tables.
